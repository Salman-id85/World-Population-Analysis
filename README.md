# World Population Analysis Using Python and SQL
Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of world population data using Python and SQL. It covers various stages of data processing, from data collection and cleaning to in-depth analysis and visualization.

# Key Features
Data Collection: Imported world population data from CSV files, covering multiple countries and years.
Data Cleaning: Processed and cleaned data to ensure accuracy and consistency, handling missing values and formatting.
# SQL Integration: Stored the cleaned data in an SQL database and used SQL queries for aggregation, filtering, and basic analysis.
Python Analysis: Leveraged Python for advanced calculations, including population growth rates and trend analysis.
# Visualization: Created insightful visualizations to depict population trends, distributions, and comparisons across countries and continents.
Predictive Modeling: Implemented basic predictive modeling to forecast future population trends for selected countries.
Technologies Used
# Python: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
# SQL (SQLite): For data storage and SQL-based analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating visualizations.
